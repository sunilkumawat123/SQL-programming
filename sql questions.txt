1. What is SQL?
Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to query, update, insert, and delete data, as well as manage database structures.

2. What are the types of SQL commands?
Answer:
SQL commands are categorized into:

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT
TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
3. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
Answer:

SQL: A language for querying and manipulating databases.
MySQL: An open-source database management system (DBMS) that uses SQL.
4. What is a Primary Key?
Answer:
A Primary Key is a column (or a set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot have NULL values.

5. What is a Foreign Key?
Answer:
A Foreign Key is a column in one table that establishes a relationship with the Primary Key of another table.

6. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
Answer:

DELETE: Removes specific rows based on a condition. It can be rolled back.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table. It cannot be rolled back.
7. What are Joins in SQL?
Answer:
Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types include:

INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
8. What is Normalization?
Answer:
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones.

9. What are the different Normal Forms?
Answer:

1NF (First Normal Form): Remove duplicate columns.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Remove partial dependency.
3NF (Third Normal Form): Remove transitive dependency.
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): Special case of 3NF.
10. What is an Index in SQL?
Answer:
An Index improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage.

11. What is a View in SQL?
Answer:
A View is a virtual table created based on the result of an SQL query. It does not store data but displays data from one or more tables.


12. What is a Subquery?
Answer:
A Subquery is a query nested within another query. It is executed first, and its result is used by the outer query.

13. What is ACID in SQL?
Answer:
ACID stands for:

A: Atomicity (All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together)
C: Consistency (Data remains consistent after a transaction)
I: Isolation (Transactions are executed independently)
D: Durability (Committed transactions persist even after a crash)
14. What is a Stored Procedure?
Answer:
A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements saved in the database that can be executed as a single unit.

15. What is a Trigger in SQL?
Answer:
A Trigger is an automatic action executed when certain events (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur in a database.

16. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
Answer:

UNION: Combines results of two queries and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines results of two queries but keeps duplicates.
17. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE?
Answer:

WHERE: Filters rows before grouping.
HAVING: Filters groups after grouping.
18. What is the difference between a Clustered and Non-Clustered Index?
Answer:

Clustered Index: Sorts and stores rows physically in the table.
Non-Clustered Index: Creates a separate structure for index entries.

19. What are Constraints in SQL?
Answer:
Constraints enforce rules on data. Common constraints include:

NOT NULL
UNIQUE
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
CHECK
20. What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators?
Answer:

BETWEEN: Filters results within a range.
IN: Filters results matching a specific set of values.


21. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
Answer:

CHAR: Fixed-length string, space-padded if the data is shorter than the defined length.
VARCHAR: Variable-length string, stores only the entered data without padding.
22. What is a Self Join?
Answer:
A Self Join is a join where a table is joined with itself. It is used to compare rows within the same table.

23. What is the difference between DISTINCT and GROUP BY?
Answer:

DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
GROUP BY: Groups rows based on a specific column(s) and can be used with aggregate functions.
24. What are Aggregate Functions in SQL?
Answer:
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Examples include:

COUNT()
SUM()
AVG()
MAX()
MIN()
25. What is a NULL value in SQL?
Answer:
NULL represents missing or unknown data in a column. It is not equivalent to zero or an empty string.

26. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
Answer:

INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from one table and matching rows from the other.
27. What is a Cursor in SQL?
Answer:
A Cursor is a database object used to retrieve data row-by-row from a result set, rather than retrieving it all at once.

28. What is the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK()?
Answer:

RANK(): Assigns a unique rank to each row, with gaps if ranks are tied.
DENSE_RANK(): Assigns a unique rank to each row, without gaps for tied ranks.
29. What are Transactions in SQL?
Answer:
A Transaction is a sequence of SQL operations executed as a single unit of work, ensuring ACID properties.

30. What is the difference between UNION and JOIN?
Answer:

UNION: Combines the result sets of two queries vertically.
JOIN: Combines data from multiple tables horizontally based on a related column.

31. What is the purpose of the EXISTS clause?
Answer:
The EXISTS clause checks if a subquery returns any rows and returns TRUE or FALSE.

32. What is a Deadlock in SQL?
Answer:
A Deadlock occurs when two or more transactions hold resources that each other needs, causing them to wait indefinitely.

33. What is the difference between DROP and DELETE commands?
Answer:

DROP: Removes the table entirely from the database.
DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition.
34. What is a Schema in SQL?
Answer:
A Schema is a logical structure that organizes database objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures.

35. What is a Composite Key?
Answer:
A Composite Key is a combination of two or more columns used to uniquely identify a row in a table.

36. What is a Temporary Table?
Answer:
A Temporary Table is a table created for temporary storage of data during a session or transaction.

37. What is the difference between Stored Procedures and Functions?
Answer:

Stored Procedures: Can return multiple results and modify data.
Functions: Return only one value and cannot modify data.
38. What is Referential Integrity?
Answer:
Referential Integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent, typically enforced using FOREIGN KEYS.

39. What is the difference between IS NULL and = NULL?
Answer:

IS NULL: Checks if a column has a NULL value.
= NULL: Invalid syntax; cannot compare NULL directly with =.
40. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic SQL?
Answer:

Static SQL: SQL statements are fixed at compile-time.
Dynamic SQL: SQL statements are constructed and executed at runtime.
